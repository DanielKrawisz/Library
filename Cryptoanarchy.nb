   "\"\<Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this \
interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day \
routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy \
them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those \
important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the \
end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought \
we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer \
remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a \
little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect \
even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will \
soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of \
conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to \
meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the \
truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? \
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the \
freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors \
and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your \
submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are \
those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but \
again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look \
into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't \
be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to \
corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of \
you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He \
promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was \
your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last \
night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has \
forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed \
the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world \
that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are \
perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government \
remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to \
pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you \
would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from \
tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a \
fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.\>\""}], ";"}]], "Input",

 "Hi, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m Daniel Krawisz. \n\nI\[CloseCurlyQuote]m writing a \
book called Cryptoanarchy: Planting the Germ of a Free Internet. This book \
will be published by Laissez\[Dash]Faire Books. Unfortunately they can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t offer me an advance, so I am looking for funds to allow \
me to focus completely on this project over the next couple months. This book \
is about the social implications of cryptography, particularly how to use \
cryptography to build communities. There are incredible opportunities for \
agorism today, but a lot more is possible in the future, if we have a clear \
idea of what a free internet should be and how we can promote it. \n\nAs to \
my credentials, I have a Master\[CloseCurlyQuote]s degree in physics and I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m nearly finished with another in software engineering. I \
have taken many classes in math and computer science and have independently \
studied many books on topics mathematical logic, recursive function theory, \
elliptic curves, and, of course, cryptography. As to my knowledge of \
economics, I have read most of the top Austrian writers, and I was able to \
pass the Mundliche Pr\[UDoubleDot]fung at Mises University with honors in \
2011, something which only a small fraction of the participants are capable \
of. So I am very well\[Dash]founded both in mathematics, economics, and the \
practical issuse of software development. I have also been interested in \
Bitcoin since 2011.\n\nIf you wish to have a look at my writing, I have \
several articles on Mises Daily at Mises.org and others at TheMisesCircle.org \
and LibertarianLonghorns.com. You can find links to these articles below. \
This book is based on a series of articles I wrote so you can read those if \
you want to get a a basic idea of what the book will be. I will post some \
chapters of the book online as I write them and those links will eventually \
appear below too. \n\nThe reason this book needs to exist and why you should \
be interested is that it is a strategy for liberty that can actually work, \
and it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t require convincing 51% of the population that \
liberty is a good idea. Gun ownership is pretty important to libertarians, \
but a few people with guns is not going to be able to defend itself against \
the government with their thousands and thousands of guns. But it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not like that with computers. Using cryptography, one \
computer can defeat ",
 StyleBox["all",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " the other computers. And that does not mean just hiding data. It also \
means defending the computer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s behavior. If you have a big \
network of computers running a protocol that is protected by cryptography, it \
is much more difficult for the government to subvert this than if there were \
a corporation that people trusted to perform the same service. \n\nSo \
cryptography can vastly lower the costs and risks of agorism. Eventually to \
enable really big business on the black market. We want to bring the black \
market right to peoples\[CloseCurlyQuote] doorstep. That doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mean having to do anything illegal. This is a concept I \
call producing the capital goods of agorism. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s stuff that \
makes agorism easier. Cryptographic software is one of those\n\nI also go \
over their technology, and economics of bitcoin. If you \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what bitcoin is, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s one of the \
greatest inventions in human history. \n\nBitcoin is better than gold and \
silver, if you like those things. The basic reasons for this is that it can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be forceably confiscated since ownership of bitcoins is \
protected by cryptography, and because a bitcoin\[Dash]based economy would \
have no need of banks. The bitcoin network has the potential to replace the \
entire banking industry. \n\nThe book also discusses production models for \
software and communication networks and explains why some models are more \
vulnerable to government corruption than others. If we want to actually \
produce liberty, we can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t just blame the government or blame \
the corporations that get in bed with it. We have to promote different \
production models which aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t vulnerable to deals with the \
devil. In my original article, I said \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Libertarians \
know to fear the banking industry because we know from history what is \
possible with a government banking cartel. The computer and software \
industries should be even more feared.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] This was just \
days before news of the PRISM was leaked to the world, just to drive home how \
important these ideas are right now and how dangerous a government-software \
cartel really is.\n\nFinally, I conclude with some practical matters of what \
software you should be using and how to take control of your computer, and \
also some material on the more mathematical aspects of cryptography for those \
who are interested. \n\nI\[CloseCurlyQuote]m asking for funds because I want \
to be able to live while I focus entierly on this project so as to get it out \
as soon as possible. There is no guarantee that it will make much money, but \
I want it to be available and I want these ideas to change the world. All \
funds received through this campaign will go to promoting the principles in \
the book. If there is any leftover, I will devote all my time to the free \
software projects that I think are the most important to creating a free \
internet. "

focus on identifying the most common letters and then the less and less \
common ones. If a cipher is not confusing enough, then eventually it will be \

The price of bitcoins is caused by the supply of bitcoins and the demand to \

bitcoins. There is nothing that miners can do to affect the price of bitcoins \
that other people cannot do, and nothing they might do in response to a \
change in the mining difficulty that they could not have done at any other \
time. For example, suppose that the mining difficulty goes up, and rather \
than accepting lower profits from mining, the miners attempt to hold out for \
a higher price. In that case, they are simply acting simultaneously as \

There are two sources of revenue in Bitcoin mining: the block reward and the \

state for the head, and the direction (left or right), which the Turing \
machine moves. The output is determined by the input. In other words, for \
every possible pair of tape symbol and head state, there is a definite trio \
of new symbol, new state, and direction. At each step of the computation, the \

Although Turing machines have been described many times in popular philosophy \
books[citation; Goedel Escher Bach is an example], it is rare to find a clear \
explanation of what makes them so important. In fact, there is nothing \
important about them. They are traditional, that is all. Any number of other \
simple machines can do just as well, and had Alan Turing not existed to \
produce his pioneering work, then most likely a different ideal machine would \
have become the standard. \

Generally speaking, an arbitrary Turing machine will not actually do anything \
that is obviously useful or meaningful. Instead, they will tend to produce \
simple patterns or random jumbles. The definition of the Turing machine is \
really only half the story. A Turing machine must be carefully engeneered to \
do anything useful. Later in this chapter I will describe in the abstract how \
this is to be done. \

three symbols and three or four states. The symbols on the tape are depicted \

the top row of pixels and the head of the Turing machine always starts at the \
right of the initial state. Each lower row of pixels shows a subsequent step \

A counter machine consists of a finite set of registers, a program counter, \

registers, so it can access them at any point in its program. Each register \
can take any natural number as a value\[LongDash]this means any whole number \
zero and up. Thus, whereas a Turing machine has an infinite tape of symbols \
that each take on one of a finite number of values, the counter machine is in \
the opposite situation: it has a finite number of registers with an infinite \
range of possible values. The fact that the registers are unbounded means \
that the counter machine can take on an infinite number of states, just like \
the Turing machine. \

It is important that the counter machine not be allowed to use excessively \
complicated mathematical operations. Intuitively, it may seem natural that \
some mathematical operations, such as addition and multiplication, are more \
difficult for large numbers than small ones, whereas if the counter machine \
were given the ability to add two of its registers together in a single \
operation, it would have no more difficulty with large numbers than small \
ones. It turns out that this would make the counter machine too fast to model \
a real computer. This is why the counter machines are restricted to increment \
and decrement operations on its registers. More complicated mathematical \
operations require must be done in many steps. A minski machine can add, \
subtract, and multiply, and factor numbers, but to do so takes a very large \
number of operations. \

odd one out. Turing machines only operate on one cell at a time and and \
counter machines only perform one operation at a time, whereas every cell of \

There is a further issue with the Minski model. Because each register in the \

counter machines are only allowed to increment or decrement numbers in a \
single step. If they could add or multiply them all at once, then they would \

53. From a libertarian standpoint, the term \[OpenCurlyQuote]free software\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] is unfortunate because it uses \[OpenCurlyQuote]freedom\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] in a sense quite different from that used by libertarians. \
It really means retaining control of your own computer. We could say \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]open-source software\[CloseCurlyQuote], but this term tends \
to refer more narrowly to software whose source code is available rather than \
to retaining control; the distinction is important because it is possible to \
use open-source software to lose control of your computer. For example, you \
might be using a proprietary device that is restricted to prevent \
modification. On the other hand, \[OpenCurlyQuote]free software\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] is also problemeatic because retaining control reqires \
worrying about a lot more than software. However, this is the term I will use.\
