   "\"\<Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this \
interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day \
routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy \
them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those \
important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the \
end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought \
we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer \
remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a \
little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect \
even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will \
soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of \
conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to \
meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the \
truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? \
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the \
freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors \
and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your \
submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are \
those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but \
again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look \
into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't \
be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to \
corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of \
you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He \
promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was \
your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last \
night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has \
forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed \
the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world \
that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are \
perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government \
remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to \
pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you \
would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from \
tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a \
fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.\>\""}], ";"}]], "Input",

generate and read encrypted messages during the Nazi period and through most \
of World War II. They each had a keyboard on them for typing an input and a \
set of lights, each with a letter of the alphabet on them, to display the \
output. To use it, a technition set an initial state by rotating three or \
more wheels on the top, each of which could each assume 26 positions, and \
defined a permutation of the alphabet in a plugboard on the bottom. He then \
typed the message on the keyboard. With each keystroke, an out letter lit up, \

Cryptography evolved from the problem of secret communication between \

to begin with, and therefore security research will tend to be drawn towards \
it. \

Suppose a general wishes to issue orders to a lieutenant. He scribbles notes \
to a messenger who runs off to the lieutenant, and he expects that the order \
to be unquestioningly obeyed. But hang on\[LongDash]he has the fog of war to \
contend with. The messenger could be waylaid or killed. He might even be \
malicious. What if he delivers the message to the enemy? What if he changes \
its contents? What if the messenger saves old messages and delivers them \
later? The problem is worse the more that the general requires perfect \
obedience from his lieutenant. The more he treats the lieutenant as an \
extension of his will, the more disastrous are the consequences of \
compromised communication. \

Cell["\<\
Clearly his protocol is badly designed because it is far too easy to abuse. \
The general requires a system immune from messenger abuse. The messenger must \
not be able to read the messages or tamper with them, and must not be able to \
lose a message or deliver it out of order without being detected. \
Furthermore, the origin of the message must be provable to the subordinate, \
and if the king should fail to prove the authenticity of his message to his \
subordinate, then he should rationally want for his subordinate to ignore the \
order. But this leaves it to the subordinate\[CloseCurlyQuote]s judgement as \
to whether the message is authenticated; therefore it is now the lieutenant\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s choice whether to obey. Cryptography is thus better \
suited to the fulfillment of contracts than to securing obedience.\

This observation may seem trivial because anyone can choose not to obey an \
order and accept the consequences, but it is not: communication between \
autonimous agents is inherently easier to secure than communication between \
master and slave.[cite Wenbo Mao on the security model. Quantum cryptography \
actually does allow for messages have provably not been read along the way.] \

control immune from tampering and physically present with the lieutenant to \
watch him, which is obviously a much greater security problem. \

cryptography, has been understood understood to be superior to RSA, an \
earlier implementation which uses ideas from number theory, the crypological \
community has been too slow to transition. However, it is an indespensible \
part of the cryptological method. For although it is possible to prove that a \
protocol is broken by demonstrating a means of breaking it, it is never \

As Bruce Schneier notes, \"Diffusion and confusion remain the cornerstone of \

to a certain extent in the theory of information entropy. There is no single, \
objective test that can prove an algorithm is sufficiently diffusive or \
sufficiently confusing. Experimentation is necessary at every step and \
tradition is both the guide and the final test. \

Under ordinary circumstances in computer science, algorithm design proceeds \
with clear definitions about what is expected of the input and what is \
desired of the output, along with constraints as to what is desirable as far \

proven. Tasks such as as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sort an arbitrary list\

algorithms that perform them is provable. \

Cipher design is not like that. The design of a cryptographic algorithm is \
rather an arcane art. One proceeds with a variety of known techniques that \

be attacks unique to a particular algorithm, or it may turn out to have weak \

A cryptologer must proceed as if everything he does has unknown weaknesses, \

have attacks against them, but they are not bad enough to make the algorithm \

As a cipher becomes better understood, an infeasible attack can evolve into a \

that it leaks enough information to admit a heuristic solution. First one can \
focus on identifying the most common letters and then the less and less \
common ones. If a cipher is not confusing enough, then eventually it will be \
totally deciphered. This is why, as Schneier says, \

The history of all bitcoin transactions are stored in a publicly available \

computers. The amount of bitcoin that a wallet contains is known by reading \
the block chain. This is how bitcoin uses the system of reputation I \

it is capable of. If it has spent all the bitcoin that have been sent to it, \

digital signature by the wallet which spends them. \

The block chain is generated by a process engineered to ensure that there is \

concern is that it is possible to make two or more transactions which \
individually are valid, but which are incompatible with one another. For \
example, suppose someone has at least one bitcoin but less than two, and he \
makes two transactions that each spend one bitcoin at the same time. Everyone \
must agree on which transaction is accepted and which is rejected. \

satisfy certain arbitrary rules. In return for transaction fees and unowned \
bitcoin, people run their computers to try to generate new blocks. Once one \
is created, it has priority and it is difficult to produce a competing block. \

there is an input, which consists of the symbol on the tape and the state of \

state for the head, and the direction (left or right), which the Turing \
machine moves. The output is determined by the input. In other words, for \
every possible pair of tape symbol and head state, there is a definite trio \
of new symbol, new state, and direction. At each step of the computation, the \

Although Turing machines have been described many times in popular philosophy \
books[citation; Goedel Escher Bach is an example], it is rare to find a clear \
explanation of what makes them so important. In fact, there is nothing \
important about them. They are traditional, that is all. Any number of other \
simple machines can do just as well, and had Alan Turing not existed to \
produce his pioneering work, then most likely a different ideal machine would \
have become the standard. \

Generally speaking, an arbitrary Turing machine will not actually do anything \
that is obviously useful or meaningful. Instead, they will tend to produce \
simple patterns or random jumbles. The definition of the Turing machine is \
really only half the story. A Turing machine must be carefully engeneered to \
do anything useful. Later in this chapter I will describe in the abstract how \
this is to be done. \

Below are some images that show typical behaviors for Turing machines with \
three symbols and three or four states. The symbols on the tape are depicted \

the top row of pixels and the head of the Turing machine always starts at the \
right of the initial state. Each lower row of pixels shows a subsequent step \
in the computation. \

A counter machine consists of a finite set of registers, a program counter, \

registers, so it can access them at any point in its program. Each register \
can take any natural number as a value\[LongDash]this means any whole number \
zero and up. Thus, whereas a Turing machine has an infinite tape of symbols \
that each take on one of a finite number of values, the counter machine is in \
the opposite situation: it has a finite number of registers with an infinite \
range of possible values. The fact that the registers are unbounded means \
that the counter machine can take on an infinite number of states, just like \
the Turing machine. \

It is important that the counter machine not be allowed to use excessively \
complicated mathematical operations. Intuitively, it may seem natural that \
some mathematical operations, such as addition and multiplication, are more \
difficult for large numbers than small ones, whereas if the counter machine \
were given the ability to add two of its registers together in a single \
operation, it would have no more difficulty with large numbers than small \
ones. It turns out that this would make the counter machine too fast to model \
a real computer. This is why the counter machines are restricted to increment \
and decrement operations on its registers. More complicated mathematical \
operations require must be done in many steps. A minski machine can add, \
subtract, and multiply, and factor numbers, but to do so takes a very large \
number of operations. \
