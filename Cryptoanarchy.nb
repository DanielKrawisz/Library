   "\"\<Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this \
interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day \
routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy \
them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those \
important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the \
end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought \
we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer \
remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a \
little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect \
even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will \
soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of \
conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to \
meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the \
truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? \
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the \
freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors \
and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your \
submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are \
those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but \
again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look \
into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't \
be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to \
corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of \
you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He \
promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was \
your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last \
night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has \
forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed \
the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world \
that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are \
perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government \
remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to \
pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you \
would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from \
tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a \
fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.\>\""}], ";"}]], "Input",

A message\[CloseCurlyQuote]s information content must be related somehow to \

It is quite possible for a perfectly entropic message to be meaningless. A \
perfectly random message will be perfectly entropic because every bit of the \
message must be an independent event. In order for a message to be \
meaningful, its receiver must be able to act differently depending on its \
content. A truly random message provides no information that can be acted \
upon because it indicates nothing about the future that was not already \

On the other hand, a random message need not be meaningless either. If it was \
a sequence of coin flips in a casino game, a random sequence can be extremely \

glory. Or suppose it recorded a sequence of results from a Magic 8-Ball or \
from some other divinatory practice, such as the orientation of cracks that \
had formed in turtle shells or bones after being treated with intense heat (a \

In these cases, the message becomes meaningful because the receivers, \

proven. Tasks such as as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sort an arbitrary list\

A cryptologer must proceed as if everything he does has unknown weaknesses, \

have attacks against them, but they are not bad enough to make the algorithm \

As a cipher becomes better understood, an infeasible attack can evolve into a \

that it leaks enough information to admit a heuristic solution. First one can \
focus on identifying the most common letters and then the less and less \
common ones. If a cipher is not confusing enough, then eventually it will be \
totally deciphered. This is why, as Schneier says, \

The price of bitcoins is caused by the supply of bitcoins and the demand to \
hold them. Mining has no effect on either of these, and therefore the price \
of bitcoins is exogenous to this analysis. In particular, an increase (or \
decrease) to the mining difficulty has no causal effect on the price of \
bitcoins. There is nothing that miners can do to affect the price of bitcoins \
that other people cannot do, and nothing they might do in response to a \
change in the mining difficulty that they could not have done at any other \
time. For example, suppose that the mining difficulty goes up, and rather \
than accepting lower profits from mining, the miners attempt to hold out for \
a higher price. In that case, they are simply acting simultaneously as \
investors and are affecting the price because of their belief that it will go \
up in the future, not because they are miners. \

There are two sources of revenue in Bitcoin mining: the block reward and the \
transaction fees. The block reward is set in advance, but the fees are not. \
Although Bitcoin user may send a transaction in the network with as large or \
small a fee as he wishes, Bitcoin payments still have a market price, which \
depends on how many people wish to make transactions and how much people want \
to pay to get them in the block chain. \

A payer buys better odds of getting his transaction confirmed soon, or at \
all. Right now it is very easy to get a transaction in a block and one can \
get away with paying nothing, but that will not always necessarily be the \
case: right now there is a 1 mb block size limit, and as soon as the blocks \
hit that limit, then it will be necessary to pay to get a transaction in the \
block chain. The price will be at the level required to limit the bit rate of \
the network to 1 mb every ten minutes. \

Cell["\<\
However, the 1 mb block size limit is arbitrary and one day the blocks will \
no longer be so restricted. Beyond it, however, there is a more fundamental \
limit on the size of the blocks and thus on the price of a transaction. A \
larger block takes longer to verify, and thus takes longer to perform the \
correct proof-of-work and to propagate throughout the network. Hence, when a \
miner confirms a transaction, he must accept it at a tradeoff: he gets the \
fee, but at a slightly reduced probability of finding a block. Miners will \
tend to accept more transactions as long as they continue to increase his \

I have so far discussed free software solely in terms of the values behind \
it, but in the tradition that thrives today, these values are enshrined in a \

the status of  a work as a collaborative enterprise that will not come with \

There are many reasons to oppose intellectual property, but the main one from \
a libertarian standpoint is that insofar as an idea must always be embodied \
in some physical form, there is no way to reconcile a property right over an \
idea with property rights over physical objects. A claim to owership over a \
book in the abstract is necessarily a claim over all printers, computers, \
paper, and any other medium capable of storing data. No matter how someone \
aquires or creates a storage medium or how he gains access to a copy of the \
book, the copyright owner claims a right to forcibly prevent him from \
reshaping his storage medium into a copy of the text of the book. \

explanation of what makes them so important. In fact, there is nothing \
important about them. They are traditional, that is all. Any number of other \
simple machines can do just as well, and had Alan Turing not existed to \
produce his pioneering work, then most likely a different ideal machine would \
have become the standard. \

Generally speaking, an arbitrary Turing machine will not actually do anything \
that is obviously useful or meaningful. Instead, they will tend to produce \
simple patterns or random jumbles. The definition of the Turing machine is \
really only half the story. A Turing machine must be carefully engeneered to \
do anything useful. Later in this chapter I will describe in the abstract how \
this is to be done. \

Below are some images that show typical behaviors for Turing machines with \
three symbols and three or four states. The symbols on the tape are depicted \
as colored pixels in the images. The initial state of the machine is always \
the top row of pixels and the head of the Turing machine always starts at the \
right of the initial state. Each lower row of pixels shows a subsequent step \
in the computation. \

A counter machine consists of a finite set of registers, a program counter, \
and a program that that is given as a list of commands out of a finite set of \
possible commands.  A counter machine also has random access to its \
registers, so it can access them at any point in its program. Each register \
can take any natural number as a value\[LongDash]this means any whole number \
zero and up. Thus, whereas a Turing machine has an infinite tape of symbols \
that each take on one of a finite number of values, the counter machine is in \
the opposite situation: it has a finite number of registers with an infinite \
range of possible values. The fact that the registers are unbounded means \
that the counter machine can take on an infinite number of states, just like \
the Turing machine. \

It is important that the counter machine not be allowed to use excessively \
complicated mathematical operations. Intuitively, it may seem natural that \
some mathematical operations, such as addition and multiplication, are more \
difficult for large numbers than small ones, whereas if the counter machine \
were given the ability to add two of its registers together in a single \
operation, it would have no more difficulty with large numbers than small \
ones. It turns out that this would make the counter machine too fast to model \
a real computer. This is why the counter machines are restricted to increment \
and decrement operations on its registers. More complicated mathematical \
operations require must be done in many steps. A minski machine can add, \
subtract, and multiply, and factor numbers, but to do so takes a very large \
number of operations. \

There is no trick to this. It is utterly prosaic. As an example, let us think \
about how to represent a string of text as a number. For example, take the \

We can begin by representing each character as a number between 0 to 99. The \
lower-case letters can be 11 to 36 and the upper case letters can be 40 to \
66. Then I will specify 71 for a space and 72 for a period. Thus, I can now \

many other ways that the string could have been represented as a number. \

63. From a libertarian standpoint, the term \[OpenCurlyQuote]free software\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] is unfortunate because it uses \[OpenCurlyQuote]freedom\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] in a sense quite different from that used by libertarians. \
It really means retaining control of your own computer. We could say \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]open-source software\[CloseCurlyQuote], but this term tends \
to refer more narrowly to software whose source code is available rather than \
to retaining control; the distinction is important because it is possible to \
use open-source software to lose control of your computer. For example, you \
might be using a proprietary device that is restricted to prevent \
modification. On the other hand, \[OpenCurlyQuote]free software\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] is also problemeatic because retaining control reqires \
worrying about a lot more than software. However, this is the term I will use.\
