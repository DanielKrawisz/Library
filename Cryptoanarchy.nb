   "\"\<Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this \
interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day \
routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy \
them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those \
important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the \
end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought \
we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer \
remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a \
little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect \
even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will \
soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of \
conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to \
meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the \
truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? \
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the \
freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors \
and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your \
submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are \
those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but \
again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look \
into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't \
be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to \
corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of \
you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He \
promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was \
your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last \
night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has \
forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed \
the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world \
that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are \
perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government \
remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to \
pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you \
would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from \
tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a \
fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.\>\""}], ";"}]], "Input",

An anarchist society should be thought of as one that is built gradually, \

it necessary to assume that there is a vacuum of power. Once two people begin \
living near enough to one another that some arrangement was needed between \
them, they could make it without one having to be master of the other or \
without binding either to an eternal covenant. As society grows, informal \

A cryptologer must proceed as if everything he does has unknown weaknesses, \

As a cipher becomes better understood, an infeasible attack can evolve into a \

that it leaks enough information to admit a heuristic solution. First one can \
focus on identifying the most common letters and then the less and less \
common ones. If a cipher is not confusing enough, then eventually it will be \
totally deciphered. This is why, as Schneier says, \

public request put forth in 1972 by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), \

carbon paper lining, the envelope leaves a carbon copy of the signature on \
the document enside. Later, the envelope can be opened and its contents shown \

one document. To benefit from a blind signature requires a notary with lots \

the time an unexpected opportunity came along, it would have lost some of its \
value. If it were less liquid than cash, then even if it were to be accepted \

Bitcoin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s difficulty is targeted to produce one block on \
average every ten minutes. The difficulty readjusts every 2016 blocks, or \
approximately every two weeks, in response to the time taken to mine the the \
previous 2016 blocks. As computational resources are added or removed from \
the network, the average rate of block generation increases or decreases, so \
the difficulty increases or decreases to compensate. \

The difficulty tends to move in response to price of Bitcoin. An increase or \
decrease in the price of Bitcoin makes mining more or less profitable at a \
given difficulty; consequently, people enter or leave the mining business in \
response to (or in anticipation of) price changes. Changes in the difficulty \
do not cause changes is the price of Bitcoin. The miners are not able to \
raise their prices in response to a difficulty increase; instead, they should \
be expected to raise their prices to whatever the market will bear without \
regard to the difficulty. This confusion is often found among people who \
resent high prices. \

In the long term, the difficulty has tended to increase faster than the \
price. This is because computer technology becomes continually cheaper and \
because the capital goods of mining have become more specialized for Bitcoin \
mining specifically. Early in Bitcoin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s history, mining was \
done on CPUs. Later, GPUs were adapted for the purpose. It was briefly \
profitable to use FPGAs to mine, but now all mining must be done on machines \
called ASICs built specifically to mine bitcoins. \

Longer term, the difficulty should also change with the overall interest rate \
of the economy. Bitcoin mining machines are capital goods, so they should be \
expected to earn their value with interest over their lifetimes. If the \
interest rate goes down or upp, then the Bitcoin miners will be more or less \
demanded. The difficulty will go up or down as more or fewer resources are \
put into mining. \

bitcoins. There is nothing that miners can do to affect the price of bitcoins \
that other people cannot do, and nothing they might do in response to a \
change in the mining difficulty that they could not have done at any other \
time. For example, suppose that the mining difficulty goes up, and rather \
than accepting lower profits from mining, the miners attempt to hold out for \

there is an input, which consists of the symbol on the tape and the state of \
the head, and an output, which consists of a new symbol for the tape, a new \
state for the head, and the direction (left or right), which the Turing \
machine moves. The output is determined by the input. In other words, for \
every possible pair of tape symbol and head state, there is a definite trio \
of new symbol, new state, and direction. At each step of the computation, the \

Although Turing machines have been described many times in popular philosophy \
books[citation; Goedel Escher Bach is an example], it is rare to find a clear \
explanation of what makes them so important. In fact, there is nothing \
important about them. They are traditional, that is all. Any number of other \
simple machines can do just as well, and had Alan Turing not existed to \
produce his pioneering work, then most likely a different ideal machine would \
have become the standard. \

Generally speaking, an arbitrary Turing machine will not actually do anything \
that is obviously useful or meaningful. Instead, they will tend to produce \
simple patterns or random jumbles. The definition of the Turing machine is \
really only half the story. A Turing machine must be carefully engeneered to \
do anything useful. Later in this chapter I will describe in the abstract how \
this is to be done. \

right of the initial state. Each lower row of pixels shows a subsequent step \

A counter machine consists of a finite set of registers, a program counter, \
and a program that that is given as a list of commands out of a finite set of \
possible commands.  A counter machine also has random access to its \
registers, so it can access them at any point in its program. Each register \
can take any natural number as a value\[LongDash]this means any whole number \
zero and up. Thus, whereas a Turing machine has an infinite tape of symbols \
that each take on one of a finite number of values, the counter machine is in \
the opposite situation: it has a finite number of registers with an infinite \
range of possible values. The fact that the registers are unbounded means \
that the counter machine can take on an infinite number of states, just like \
the Turing machine. \

It is important that the counter machine not be allowed to use excessively \
complicated mathematical operations. Intuitively, it may seem natural that \
some mathematical operations, such as addition and multiplication, are more \
difficult for large numbers than small ones, whereas if the counter machine \
were given the ability to add two of its registers together in a single \
operation, it would have no more difficulty with large numbers than small \
ones. It turns out that this would make the counter machine too fast to model \
a real computer. This is why the counter machines are restricted to increment \
and decrement operations on its registers. More complicated mathematical \
operations require must be done in many steps. A minski machine can add, \
subtract, and multiply, and factor numbers, but to do so takes a very large \
number of operations. \

It really means retaining control of your own computer. We could say \

to refer more narrowly to software whose source code is available rather than \
to retaining control; the distinction is important because it is possible to \

might be using a proprietary device that is restricted to prevent \
modification. On the other hand, \[OpenCurlyQuote]free software\
