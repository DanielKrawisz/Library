The movie would start out following some petty interactions of a few main \
characters in a world in which there are only a few main characters with \
differentiation from one another supported by a vast number of \
interchangeable secondary characters. This is quite common in kids\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] movies. Just think of the animal friends in Disney movies, \
those yellow things in Despicable Me. This is especially true in movies that \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have fully developed logically consistent worlds. Now \
the thing about these background characters. If you think about the \
background characters for a moment, you realize that they have no possibility \
of happiness because they are in a hopeless situation serving roles that \
require no individualism or any chance for self development.

Anyway, the main character is in some sort of silly problem with some of the \
other ones that would be totally cliche for this kind of movie but then \
suddenly something happens to make the main character starts actually \
imagining what it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s like to be the other major characters. \
He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s never done this before, and it changes how he interacts \
with them. He starts saying things that is taylored to their own mental \
state. Furthermore, he is able to describe his own state to them in a way \
that they can begin to understand. He begins to see them as identities that \
are deeper than simply those characteristics most obvious to him. It was \
fascinating, but also shocking that such a useful means of thinking had been \
lost to him for so long. How had it never occurred to him to think this way? \
In a way he, was uncomfortable with it. Something in him sensed that it was \
dangerous knowledge.

He then starts thinking about his own memories and about earlier states that \
he has been in with the other main characters. Previously these memories had \
been almost entirely forgotten by him because his current state was incapable \
of empathizing with his former state and could not reshape its mind to \
remodel the memories. Hence they were practically invisible to it. He is now \
a bigger person--extending further back in time and into the future before. \
These moments have become more present with him and integrated with the \
current moment, which now seems less important.

However, his thoughts now turn to aforementioned secondary characters. \
Viewers might have said to themselves, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]oh well it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just a movie so you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re not supposed to \
take it so seriously.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] if they thought about it at \
all. But suddenly one of the main characters WOULD start to take it \
seriously!! This character would gradually come to grips with the fact that \
his entire world was filled with misery and suffering and cruelty that he had \
no inkling of but which should have been obvious had he even tried to think \
about it even once.

But he hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wanted to think about it. He had tried not to. \
He had told himself that the creatures were happy in their own way and they \
had no need of individual autonomy or self-reflection. He propagated cruelty \
upon them because he had told himself that they enjoyed it, that it was what \
they needed.

Why? Why had he done such a thing over and over for such a long time without \
noticing the cruelty or self-deception? And then he remembers. He was once \
one of them. He was once an undifferentiated minor character with no \
independent goals or emotions other than what the major characters required. \
He had spent centuries in abject hopelessness, just like they are now, and he \
had entirely forgotten. How could it be possible?

He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a much larger creature now. Much bigger than he had \
been before because he can encompass all minds. He knows he can control no \
one, but he might hope one day to draw others into the place he is. What he \
knows cannot be conveyed in words. People must voluntarily transform \
themselves at his invitation. \

This is a remake of The Happening. The plants mind-control people to feel \
suicidal. They tell themselves that these feelings are not really theirs, but \
they can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help internalizing them gradually. As they \
attempt to defeat the force, come up with more and more profound \
justifications for suicide that they then must to argue themselves out of.

Eventually they agree that live is objectively not worth living, but that \
they will certainly forget that conclusion when the force is removed so they \
will tough it out further.

Finally, they conclude that the force cannot be stopped and kill themselves. \
However, the facts remaining at the end indisputably prove that the answer \
had been right there but none had thought of it, thus proving that they had \
fully internalized their suicidal feelings and did not want to find the \
answer. \

There was once a boy who build a round drum made out of a material that \
deformed permanently as waves flowed through it. As he experimented with \
certain sequences of taps repeated around the outside, he found sequences of \
beats that would transform it into a fractal. It was like a corrugated \
fractal drum that permanently deformed each time it was struck. He struck its \
edges with his hammer and nonlinear waves flowed through the drum, which \
changes its fractal shape. He could train the fractal by layering sequences \
of techniques upon it. He does this many times and his mind begins to mirror \
the drum and he develops an intuitive sense of how it will behave.

His work is to find metaphors of his own feelings to describe what happens to \
the fractal as he constructs it. As he experiments, whenever he finds a \
promising metaphor, he studies the fractal he built most carefully and \
attempts to build a set of new fractals that are build with as many \
variations as he can find on the first. As he rebuilds them, he attempts to \
replay the emotional state in his mind for which they are supposed to have \
been a metaphor and and to vary his own emotions in accordance with the \
variation made upon the material. If he is able to do so, he files this as a \
successful experiment and will use it again in more complicated drum patterns \
later on. Of course, he cannot know to what extent the experiment detected a \
pre-existing feature or caused him to learn a new behavior.

Eventually he develops a model of his mind, partly by learning to fit himself \
to his fractal experiments and partly because they experiments fit to him. He \
has constructed a language that attaches his mind to the physical world. He \
has a diagram of his mind that he can think about consciously. He has \
developed a language with which he can talk to his own mind

He invents new diagrams that are variations upon his model. He reshapes his \
mind according to the language he has developed connecting him to the \
diagram. He finds his way into other minds, other people, animals, and even \
into things that are not minds--things far too simple to be conscious. He \
learns how to articulate what it is like to be asleep, and learns new \
directions in the emotional space available to him, with clues as to how he \
might achieve them, owing to his map of emotion he has previously built.

He goes into both the future and the past. He observes the relative \
simplicity that would be found in his mind were he subjected to the \
unstimulating, unrewarding environment of the past. And he learned what was \
necessary to make his mind more rich and more vast. He could now begin to \
build the future that would produce it.

It is very odd because he has a diagram whose emotional states he can label. \
The digram can be happy or sad--it can feel anything. He has solved the \
mind-body problem. He has reconstructed his mind in a substance admits \
processes that can serve as metaphors.

He trains his mind to become more and more flexible, and to take on more and \
more shapes. He can transform into anything. He is the entire human race. No, \
the entire class of intelligent beings. So are all his friends because they \
have learned his technique from them. They are becoming less individualistic \
because they all can transform into one another. They are not individuals. \
They are universals. But as soon as they reach that moment they become \
unstable because they have no reference left that stores their identity--the \
mental processes that direct their transformation are random and arise out of \
the randomness of what they were doing to themselves at the moment. Their \
transformations after that are disorganized. They have become physical \
processes. They have disintegrated.

I feel like an ancient person from thousands of years ago. I had to describe \
that as a story with metaphor and that was the only way I could begin. I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t quite know how to articulate what I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m \
thinking about yet. I feel like I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m slowly teaching myself \
something. \

For a few years now I have been telling stories about growth, transformation, \
thought, and empathy. At the time, I would have said I was exploring these \
topics because I was curious about the concept of the singularity and the \
implications of singulatarian technology on humans. I was about to say that \
there was a subconscious reason I was working on those stories, but there was \
none. Rather, the process of imagining these stories has caused my mind to to \
develop new behaviour that it was not familiar with before. There was no \
prior subconscious motive; rather it is that I can now interpret my past \
actions in terms of my new ideas, and in light of those new ideas, my past \
actions appear to be purposeful.

Here is a concrete example. My cat now jumps on top of the couch arm when he \
wants to play and he uses this behavior to communicate his desire to me. This \
rule was not designed; rather it happened that randomly I started playing \
with him after he jumped on the couch arm and he associated the two and then \
trained me to follow through with it by acting indignant if I didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t play when he jumped up on the couch arm. Now that this \
behavior has become meaningful, it looks like our past actions were primitive \
attempts to send signals rather than random interactions.

That is what happened in my mind. Anyway, over the weekend \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve started to develop a theory of mind. The stories \
altered my mind each time I developed one and the result of that evolution \
was to produce a mind that could conceive of my theory of mind.

I was thinking about how I read that you can ask Tajikistan peasants \
ridiculously simple hypothetical questions and they won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be \
able to answer, although they have a perfectly sophisticated knowledge of \
concrete things in their world. It seemed necessary to conclude that a normal \
human mind may develop without having learned abstract thought. Abstract \
thought is possible with what we have, but not inevitable. I thought about \
what kind of data structure would be capable of doing something that is not \
abstract thought, but which could through normal operation develop abstract \
thought.

I was also thinking about learning language because of something I had just \
wrote in my cryptoanarchy book. Babies would learn a language by listening to \
the language input and detecting its structure by frequency analysis. It \
would learn what kinds of sounds contained less information and which \
contained more. This is basically what a compression algorithm does. It looks \
for sequences in data that are repeated and compresses the data by replacing \
those repeating sequences with references to a single instance. This same \
strategy could be used to develop a data structure capable of detecting a \
hierarchical structure which can analyse sentences on all levels of \
structure: phonemes, syllables, words, phrases, and sentences. Context can \
then give words meanings.

I realized that the same method could be used not just with language, but \
with experience in general. One could attempt to use a compression algorithm \
on ones own experience to establish meaningful observations and associate \
them with appropriate actions.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll tell you more later. I need to get to sleep. I feel \
like someone in ancient times who could only express himself in parables. It\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s very odd. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m still developing the \
concept. \

The word for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]one\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in many \
indo-european languages comes from the proto-indo-european word for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]finger\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \
Doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t that seem crazy? Didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t those \
idiots know what a number is??

When I need to count, I move my fingers in sequence. This allows me to count \
up to ten. I also have the memory of moving fingers in my mind. And I have my \
compression algorithm, which has been adapted to concept formation. The \
compression algorithm attempts to find higher- and higher-order means of \
describing my experience.

Metaphors are the basic unit of the compression algorithm. If I can compare \
two things to one another and develop ways of describing one in terms of \
another, then I can compress my experience more efficiently and hone in on \
more useful information hidden in it.

My fingers are now a metaphor for that which I need to count. The memory of \
the motion of the fingers in my mind allows me to treat things that come in \
similar units as countable entities. If I can learn to use my fingers as \
metaphors for a metaphorical hand, I can count up to 100. I have piped two \
functions together which now enable me to think better than I could before.

Now suppose that when I was first learning to count, my eighth finger was \
damaged. All of my concepts for numbers have been adapted from \
representations of body motions in my mind. I start counting without a native \
concept for number, so when I reach 8, I can sill think about the wound in my \
finger. 8 becomes an unlucky number for me because I naturally notice \
anything that goes wrong around the number 8 than other numbers. That is \
because the concepts for numbers are not native to my mind, but were adapted, \
and they were not entirely separated from that which they grew out of.

However, the process of concept formation, which I had used to create markers \
in my mind that could serve to make my counting more sophisticated, comes to \
my rescue. The relevant process is not analysis of the outside world, but of \
my mind. I have concepts for one, two, three, and so on, but I have never \
said a word for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]number\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. I am \
confused because I can detect that my thoughts are less ordered they could \
be. I tell myself stories about someone who goes insane because he can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stop counting higher and higher. I am providing myself \
with new experiences by weaving stories. I am putting together some of my \
ideas together in ways that make the most sense that I can, and in the \
process I gain experience about how my compression algorithm works. I learn \
what I think is important and relevant because those are the elements that \
appear in my stories. Finally, my compression algorithm finds how to compress \
its own functions. It finds a more general concept that helps to organize its \
own activity--the number. I now have a name for what I have been thinking \
about.

I have now further removed my mathematical thinking from its visceral \
origins. I can think theoretically about them and the pain on my finger is no \
longer distorting my thoughts to the same degree.\

I had been thinking about a lot of confusing things for a long time. The \
first was religion. I am so confused by religion. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
understand how it can exist, how anyone can take it seriously how it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s like human race is just inherently crazy. I kept \
wondering what it was like to be religious so that I could finally understand \
how it works in people, how they can apparently just not apply logic to \
everything. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been going on for a while.

I was also thinking about future people and what it would be like to be able \
to engineer ones own mind. I was thinking about the singularity and what \
would happen when people developed the ability to engineer their minds and \
bodies. I concluded that they would probably outsource more functions of \
their minds until they were nothing left and that intelligence would \
effectively all fall apart as the singularity got underway. I wrote a story \
about that. I was thinking about minds then, but I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d actually come up with a theory of mind. It seemed \
like too difficult of a problem, but my theory hinged on the mind being \
understood, at least to some extent. Thinking about this provoked me into \
thinking more deeply about the implications of a theory of mind, and this \
alone prepared me with inklings of what such a theory would be like.

I read a strange book called The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of \
the Bicameral Mind. This book propounds a very odd theory about how people \
thought very differently in the past and in the earliest historic times would \
not have had consciousness as we know it. I thought that the author\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s interpretation was odd but that the evidence he presented \
was surprising and very much did suggest something different was going on in \
peoples\[CloseCurlyQuote] minds in the past. An important feature of this \
book is its musings on the development of human language and the importance \
of metaphor in that process. All our abstract words grew out of bizarre \
abstractions and generalizations of concrete words. For example, the english \
word \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]be\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] comes from the same \
root as the Sanskrit word \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]bhu\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], \
meaning \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to grow\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]am\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] both come from the same \
root as the Sanskrit \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]asmiy\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
which means, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to breath\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. I had \
earlier attempted to create a fantasy language generator for use writing \
fantasy novels, and I realized reading this book that I could not develop a \
realistic language evolution simulator without a metaphor generator. I had no \
idea how a metaphor generator would work and it would surely require more \
information to work correctly to be worthwhile for my project, but that got \
me thinking about the idea of a realistic metaphor generator and how it could \
work.

A theme of ignorance and learning appeared in a number of the stories I had \
described during this period. Some had been about people who grew to be new \
people, and some where about people looking into the ignorance of their past \
and coming to know it again. I think that is what I was going to do, is to \
reconnect with a prior state of ignorance so as to glimpse what I am ignorant \
of today.

Furthermore, during this time I had several experiences with empathy. This \
helped to focus my thoughts on something on which I was ignorant. I thought \
about my ignorance of what it was like to be other people, and how much I \
wanted to learn what other experiences were like. Of course, the best way to \
learn how to empathize generally would be to have a theory of mind. I didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see that at the time, but now it seems obvious. If you \
had a general theory of mind that you could apply to yourself, you could use \
it to tell yourself how to change your mind in order to be like someone else\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. A general theory of mind would necessarily mean an \
expansion of human empathy.

One other thing that stands out in my memory was how Lemon developed a way of \
telling me that he wants to play. At some point, just by coincidence, I must \
have started playing with him while he was sitting on the arm of my couch. He \
noticed a pattern there where there really was none, and then began to move \
to sit on the couch arm when he wanted to play. When I \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t play, he meowed and acted like he was annoyed and \
wanted something. When I started playing, he shut up and had fun. Soon I \
learned that when he jumped on the couch arm, he wanted to play. We had \
trained each other by accident. This was spontaneous order. It was something \
meaningful which was not meaningful before. Lemon could now \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]talk\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to me, in his own way.

Then two things set me off the other day to set me in the right direction. \
There were some things in my mind that set me on track of where I ended up. I \
read this thing about how Tajikistan peasants have a sophisticated local \
botanical knowledge and so on but they have trouble answering very simple \
hypothetical questions. This made me think back to earlier instances of \
surprising ignorance that I had read about. For example, the Pythagoreans \
were some of the first mathematicians and they thought that four was \
identical with justice. That clearly is nonsensical. How could they have been \
doing math, yet somehow still have acted as if they were just creating \
another silly Greek mystery religion? I thought very hard about how much \
things seem obvious in retrospect and how people are not able to experience \
their own prior state of ignorance and utterly forget what it was like. Maybe \
even the basic building blocks of logical thought, like \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]relation\[CloseCurlyQuote] or \[OpenCurlyQuote]number\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] were only obvious in retrospect. I wondered just what that \
prior state of ignorance would be like.

The other thing was that I read a paper on the entropy of various written \
languages as research for my cryptoanarchy book. The payer compared \
translations of the Bible in several different languages and hypothesized \
that a compression algorithm should compress all translations of the bible to \
files of a similar length even though before compression they were different \
lengths. The paper\[CloseCurlyQuote]s data supported the hypothesis. This \
made a lot of sense because the whole point of compression is to remove \
redundancy in the file, to detect parts of the file that are repetitive or \
which can otherwise be describe in terms of an overarching principle. The \
file that remained if it were perfectly compressed, would contain the actual \
information content of the message and nothing extra.

I wrote about this in my book as a way to explain why human messages are \
always of a low-to-medium entropy rather than high entropy. I used the \
example of text in human languages and showed how they were far from \
maximally entropic. Then I wrote, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is how a baby \
can learn a language when it has never heard language before.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I then described how the baby looks for redundancies \
in the human language it hears and soon begins to separate the language into \
a series of atomic sounds. I thought about that again, and I realized that \
once the baby had done this, the sounds themselves could be analysed further \
to group the sounds into higher units. A baby who was paying attention could \
very well understand the syllabic structure of a language by the same \
process, and from there learn the word structure, the phrase structure, and \
the sentence structure, purely by searching for redundancies in the message.

But how exactly would you search for redundancies in the message? This was \
days later, but once I asked that question I at once realized that the baby \
would have something in its mind that worked like the compression algorithm \
described in the paper. The compression algorithm would search for identical \
items in the stream so as to compress them out, so as to focus on the more \
meaningful parts of the message. It would develop a kind of hierarchical data \
structure that would represent the levels of structure of the language. \
Furthermore, if it were a lossy form of compression (meaning that it is \
allowed to drop some information, like a jpeg file format), there would be \
value in looking for similarities and representing things as classes of \
similar items. The compressor would end up with something like concepts. 

I wrote in my cryptoanarchy book that the babies would learn the first \
meanings of words by the context, but I continued thinking about that and I \
wondered just how that would work. I soon realized that this would work the \
same way, only the compression algorithm must be applied to all of the baby\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s experience rather than just the sounds of the words. The \
word \[OpenCurlyQuote]ball\[CloseCurlyQuote] connected to the experience of \
balls would be a new item that appeared more often than random in the baby\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s experience, and it could therefore be used as a concept \
to describe its experience. Hence the algorithm would ultimately have a data \
structure grow in it that correctly interpreted the meaning of the words and \
the grammatical structure of the language. This was remarkable. I knew how to \
make a computer understand English, given enough of the right experience. I \
had imagined something that could generate a high-level description of any \
data given to it, just like the sort of data contained in human writing.

I began to think further what might happen if there was such a compression \
algorithm and some experience it could work on, and I thought, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What if, somehow, one of the data structures used in \
the understanding of language turned out to be useful in another context? \
That would If something like this would indeed happen if the compression \
algorithm were applied not only to its experience, but to its own set of data \
structures. It would then be able to recognize that similar compression rules \
in different contexts could be associated with one another to save space in \
its own thoughts. It would begin to develop rules that would extract meaning \
from its own computation, as if that computation were itself a language, just \
like that which its parents taught it. Its own series of data analysis would \
be treated as a meaningful hidden message, if only it could be deciphered.

If the compression algorithm were applied to the compression algorithm\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s own data structure, then the algorithm would generate a \
high-level description of its own process and of itself. Furthermore, I \
already knew that there cannot be a perfect compression algorithm because the \
perfect compression would be an NP problem. It would have to work by \
continually testing new associations and could not work as well by being \
hard-coded. It sounds very much like it was conscious.

This thing would naturally think in terms of metaphor because it would begin \
with no means of thought other than linking two categories together which \
derived from experience. If it observed that tomatos are round and red, and \
the sun is round and red, it could tentatively attempt to describe \
experiences with the sun in terms of its tomato concept and vice versa so as \
to see if it could further compress its experience by using such a category. \
That is a metaphor. This data structure I have described sounds like it would \
act exactly like metaphors do in our minds, and I think it explains why early \
cultures seemed only able to describe their experience in terms of mythology, \
even every-day things. Metaphor was the basic tool they had to think with, \
and it was the basic means of theorizing about the world. They really could \
have been without abstract thought at all. To a compression algorithm, \
metaphors are natural. The fact that a sun and a tomato seem metaphysically \
so different from one another would not mean anything to it. If it was able \
to run more efficiently by linking them together in a category, it would.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m finally able to express this idea in words. Before they \
were just pictures and intuitions. I already sent several rambling letters to \
another friend about this, but the last six paragraphs I was not able to put \
into words until now. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been such a strange experience. I \
really DID feel ignorant as it was happening. I empathized with someone \
ignorant, and that person was me, and I did it by finally focusing my mind on \
what I had been missing for so long, which was an understanding of the very \
process I was going through. The act of empathizing with ignorance showed me \
my ignorance. It was a gradual awakening, but once I was able to confront it, \
it was defeated because its form was, itself, the missing knowledge that I \
sought.

That last paragraph may sound crazy, but maybe I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be \
better able to put it into words soon. The amazing thing was that I really \
felt like I was someone in the past, someone who lacked a concept which one \
day everyone would have learned at such a young age that they cannot imagine \
lacking it. I felt like Aesop, who could only express his ideas in fables but \
who either could not himself make general statements about human nature or \
could not expect his audience to expect such things. I felt like Herodotus \
attempting to write his history and ethnography before those words existed. \
Originally, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]historia\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] just \
meant \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]inquiry\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. I also recalled \
the early pre-Socratics and the extremely awkward way they attempted to \
describe the national world without precise words for forces or motion and \
such. I felt like that. I knew something that I could not express \
conceptually. I told stories about themes that confused me, and thereby \
gained vicarious experience in them. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m still doing that \
now with you, but now the story is about myself. The stories provided further \
data for compression by my compression algorithm. It began to develop rules \
about the meaning of ignorance and learning and gradually developed a concept \
able to explain the stories I told to it: and that was itself.

It seemed to explain a lot about stupidity. It explained how ignorance could \
be as deep as was apparently possible. A species with a compression algorithm \
like the one I had described, might begin with almost nothing and still be \
capable of achieving a lot with very little that was innately programmed in. \
(This is not to say that real humans are \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]blank slates\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] at birth. It is important from a philosophical \
standpoint that this can all be built up from very little, but in the real \
world you would expect evolution to help out a little bit with the learning.) \
There was already the example of language that I described previously. \
Language would develop from nothing out of many experiences like that which I \
had with Lemon. It should develop a grammar automatically because the same \
process can create meaning on any structural level in the signals being \
exchanged, just as learn patterns in any level of structure of the language \
presented to it. Then there was the development of mythology, which I \
described above. I had wondered how mythology could appear so wonderful, so \
full of meaning and constructed out of such poignant metaphors when ancient \
people were simultaneously so surprisingly unsophisticated. I think I have an \
explanation.

I then began to think about how someone could develop rational thought under \
these circumstances. How could a construct of random metaphors be constructed \
into something like a rule of logic? I thought about how the word for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]one\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in many indo-european \
languages developed from the word in proto-Indo-European for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]finger\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. A creature that was \
able to move its fingers in sequence might learn to count if it had occasion \
to. Suppose the creature happened to  move its fingers as it stacked fruits \
in its den (or whatever). Its compression algorithm would randomly attempt to \
compress its experience by using its finger motions as a metaphor for the \
fruit. Eventually, it might learn that the metaphor worked best, with the \
greatest degree of compression, if it maintained one finger-motion per fruit. \
It then begins naturally to move its fingers in sequence to count fruit \
because this action makes its experience more compressable, more easily \
characterized. At this point it does not know how to count beyond 10 and it \
has no words for any number other than those words it uses to describe its \
own fingers. However, it can learn to count higher if it begins to use a \
finger as a metaphor for another hand. It can then count to 100. It now has \
two kinds of numbers that it can use: those which are counted on fingers, and \
those which are counted on fingers counting on fingers. The fact of having \
different kinds of numbers becomes now provides an avenue for the abstraction \
of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]number\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] into its own \
concept. Furthermore, if it must begin to count higher than 100, it will need \
to think of hands counting hands counting things, and this eventually \
provides a rout to the abstraction of the concept of a digit and thus to \
begin thinking generally about numbers. Furthermore, it may also discover a \
regulative role of numerical operations. Its experience can be more deeply \
compressed when its numerical operations obey rules. If 3 + 5 sometimes \
equals 8 and sometimes 7 or 9, then that is a far less compressible \
experience then one in which 3 + 5 always equals 8.

The same could explain the development of all logical reasoning. Once it \
began to hear the first attempts at rational arguments, it can begin telling \
itself things that are like stories, only they are no longer random myths, \
but random sequences of claims. The vicarious experience it would gain this \
way would ultimately not only be the categorization of arguments into valid \
and invalid, but the regulative principle that prefers the valid over the \
invalid, owing to the greater compressibility of experience that it allows.

My theory explained a lot. Had I actually made progress on a centuries-old \
philosophical problem? It explained how I could be rational and yet so many \
others were not, and especially about how horribly stupid people were in the \
past. This also explained some of the crazy stuff I had been reading about \
psychoanalysis and about how peoples\[CloseCurlyQuote] early relationships \
serve as models for their later ones, and how early memories can deeply \
affect someone without their knowing why, or even recalling the original \
memory. It explains why the psychotherapy, the talking cure, can help me. It \
was exactly the process of learning and abstraction that I had described with \
numbers. An old experience works as the model for an abstract category that \
has not yet been fully named. Stories can help the mind to extract the \
category from that experience and think about it rationally. Once the \
category has been described explicitly, once it can be talked about \
abstractly and thought about abstractly, then it has been separated from the \
bad experience that made in painful later on.

Furthermore, it explains the curious connection I had seen between recovery \
from PTSD and the process of individuation, as described by Karl Jung. They \
are the same. The recovery from PTSD is as I described above. As for \
individuation, the compression algorithm I had imagined would be difficult to \
characterize, just like the natural world and languages, for whose \
characterization I had originally imagined it to act upon. If it acted upon \
itself, it would soon come up with metaphorical characterizations of itself. \
It would begin to state rough rules to characterize its own responses. It \
would present higher- and higher-level descriptions of who it is and what \
makes it happy. I am still trying to learn how to describe its happiness in \
terms of the most basic ideas in behaviorism, but I am not quite there yet. \
Anyway, the more it can describe its own happiness, the more it can become \
happy. And it is by learning the details of its own idiosyncrasies, coming to \
terms with its own individuality, that happiness is possible. Aristotle was \
right about happiness all along.

Finally, this all seemed to provide an answer to a question that had confused \
me for some time. Would extraterrestrial intelligent life like to tell \
stories, like humans do? Humans are often characterized as story-telling \
animals, but was this really something special to humans? And if aliens did \
tell stories, what kinds of stories would they tell? In my theory, I also had \
a way to explain how story-telling is beneficial to thought, which I had \
experienced myself as I learned about it. If there is a process in your mind \
which provides you with intuitive thought about something, but which you \
cannot yet articulate in words, it is a process that has not yet been \
sufficiently \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]compressed\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] so as \
to be described in terms of smaller meaningful elements. By telling stories, \
I can use that process that is not yet a conscious thought. I can provide \
myself with extra vicarious experience of using the thought so that it can be \
put in context and from there brought into conscious thought. But according \
to my theory, a simple learning process like that which I had described was \
inherently capable of learning by telling itself stories. I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I am able to say this totally convincingly yet, but \
I think that any intelligence ought to work similarly to what I had \
described. Therefore, I think that it is likely that an extraterrestrial race \
really would tell stories, although their themes might be quite different.

Ok there you go. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what I figured out. I hope that \
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t sound too crazy! I know this might sound a little \
far out, even for me, but before I have always been so articulate about what \
I know, and this is the first time in a long time that I have felt so \
inarticulate about something. I have achieved a state of conscious ignorance. \
I feel like an enlightened baby. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m really teaching myself \
something, just like I would have had to have done again and again when I was \
a baby! There are a few things I want to do still, and one of them, as I said \
is to describe happiness. Another main one is to describe a train-of-thought \
that seems similar enough to my experience of it. The last item on my list is \
to describe the development of hypothetical reasoning more clearly. \
